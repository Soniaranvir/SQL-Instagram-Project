# SQL-Instagram-Project

📸 **Instagram Data Model & Analytics Project**

---

📖 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on designing and analyzing a data model for Instagram using PostgreSQL. The model includes key entities such as users, posts, comments, likes, and followers. By implementing this project, we demonstrate the creation of a relational database, data insertion, updates, and the application of advanced SQL techniques for analytics. The project serves as a foundation for understanding database design and query optimization.

🎯 **Objectives**  
- **Data Modeling:** Design and implement a relational database for Instagram-like features.
- **Data Manipulation:** Showcase SQL queries to create, insert, and update data in the database.
- **Analytics with SQL:** Perform advanced analytics using SQL clauses such as `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, subqueries, and window functions.
- **Date and Aggregation Handling:** Analyze trends using date functions, aggregation, and case statements.

🔑 **Features & Key Functionalities**  
- **Database Design:** Created tables for users, posts, comments, likes, and followers with proper relationships and constraints.  
- **Data Insertion:** Inserted sample data to simulate real-world use cases of Instagram.  
- **SQL Analytics:**  
  - User activity analysis (e.g., number of posts, likes, and comments).  
  - Popularity ranking of posts and users.  
  - Classification of posts and users based on engagement levels using case statements.  
  - Trend analysis using date-related queries.  
- **Advanced SQL Techniques:** Utilized window functions, CTEs, and subqueries for complex queries.

🔍 **Key Insights**  
- **User Engagement:** Identified the most active users based on the number of posts and comments.  
- **Post Popularity:** Ranked posts by likes, revealing high-engagement content.  
- **Follower Analysis:** Determined which users have the most followers, showcasing their influence.  
- **Engagement Patterns:** Categorized posts into "new," "recent," and "old" based on creation dates.

📂 **Database Structure**  
**Key Tables:**  
1. **Users:** Contains user information like names, emails, and phone numbers.  
2. **Posts:** Tracks user-generated posts, captions, and creation timestamps.  
3. **Comments:** Stores comments made by users on posts.  
4. **Likes:** Captures likes given to posts by users.  
5. **Followers:** Details user-follow relationships.

- **PostgreSQL:** Database used for modeling and querying data.  
- **SQL Features Explored:**  
  - Data manipulation (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`).  
  - Filtering and sorting (`WHERE`, `ORDER BY`).  
  - Aggregation (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`).  
  - Relationship-based queries (`JOINS`).  
  - Analytical features like window functions and CTEs.  
  - Date manipulation and trend analysis.
